Running in Debug
If you want to get a bit more information, you can take activate the Conditional Compilation blocks in the code by compiling with the appropriate flags set. If we take one of these blocks as an example :

view sourceprint?
1 $IF $$debug $THEN 

2             DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('dependent_objs count for ' 

3                 ||tbl_tabs(i).table_owner||'.'||tbl_tabs(i).table_name  

4                 ||' = '||tbl_dep_objs.COUNT);  

5             l_start := DBMS_UTILITY.GET_TIME;  

6         $END 
The IF statement ( or $IF statement) is looking for a variable called debug being set to true. You can activate this code as follows :

SQL> ALTER SESSION SET PLSQL_CCFLAGS='debug:TRUE'  

  2  /  

   

Session altered.  

   

SQL> ALTER PROCEDURE crud COMPILE  

  2  /  

   

Procedure altered.  

   

SQL> 
Now we’ll get the debug lines out when we run the procedure :

set serveroutput on size 1000000  

set timing on  

spool crud.log  

BEGIN  

    crud( pa_refresh => 'Y');  

END;  

/  

spool off 
If you look in the crud.log file we’ve just written the output to, you’ll find entries such as :

dependent_objs count for HR.EMPLOYEES = 3  

Total time for table HR.EMPLOYEES - 0 seconds.
